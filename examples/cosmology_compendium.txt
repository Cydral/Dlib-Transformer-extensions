Cosmology derives from the Greek kosmos, meaning order or world, and logos, meaning study or discourse, thus constituting the study of the ordered universe as a unified whole. This discipline occupies a unique position among the sciences, addressing questions about the origin, structure, evolution, and ultimate fate of everything that exists. Unlike other branches of physics that can isolate systems for repeated experimentation, cosmology confronts the singular challenge of studying a unique object, the universe itself, from within, with no external vantage point and no possibility of experimental repetition. The philosophical implications of this methodological constraint have occupied thinkers from antiquity to the present, raising fundamental questions about the limits of scientific knowledge when applied to totality itself.@@The ancient Greeks conceived of the cosmos as a finite, spherical system with Earth at its center, surrounded by crystalline spheres carrying the Moon, Sun, planets, and fixed stars. This geocentric cosmology, elaborated by Aristotle and mathematically refined by Ptolemy, persisted for nearly two millennia as the dominant Western worldview. The universe was considered eternal and unchanging in its essential structure, with celestial motions following perfect circles as befitted the divine realm beyond the Moon. This cosmological framework was not merely astronomical but carried profound theological and philosophical significance, placing humanity at the literal center of creation.@@The Copernican revolution displaced Earth from the cosmic center, initiating a progressive demotion of human significance that continues to characterize cosmological discovery. Copernicus placed the Sun at the center of the planetary system, while later observations revealed the Sun to be an ordinary star among billions in the Milky Way, which itself proved to be one galaxy among billions in the observable universe. This cosmological principle, the assumption that our location is not special, has become a foundational methodological commitment in modern cosmology, guiding the interpretation of observations and the construction of theoretical models.@@Isaac Newton's theory of universal gravitation provided the first physical framework for cosmology, describing how matter attracts matter across the void of space. Newton himself recognized a profound puzzle in applying his theory to an infinite, uniform universe: such a configuration would be gravitationally unstable, with matter tending to collapse into ever-larger concentrations. He tentatively resolved this by positing an infinite universe where gravitational attractions balanced from all directions, though this equilibrium was later shown to be unstable against small perturbations. The Newtonian cosmological problem foreshadowed deeper issues that would require general relativity for their resolution.@@Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity, published in 1915, replaced Newton's conception of gravity as a force with a geometric description of spacetime curvature caused by mass and energy. This framework proved essential for cosmology, as the universe's large-scale behavior depends critically on the interplay between matter content and spacetime geometry. Einstein's field equations relate the curvature of spacetime to the distribution of matter and energy, providing the mathematical foundation for all modern cosmological models. The theory predicts phenomena unknown to Newtonian physics, including the expansion of space itself, gravitational waves, and black holes.@@When Einstein applied his field equations to the universe as a whole in 1917, he sought a static, eternal solution consistent with the prevailing astronomical view. Finding that his equations naturally predicted either expansion or contraction, he introduced the cosmological constant, a term representing a uniform energy density of empty space that could balance gravitational attraction and permit a static universe. This modification, which Einstein later reportedly called his greatest blunder, would return decades later as a possible explanation for cosmic acceleration. The episode illustrates how theoretical prejudices can influence even the greatest physicists when confronting the cosmos.@@Alexander Friedmann, a Russian mathematician and meteorologist, derived solutions to Einstein's equations in 1922 that described expanding or contracting universes, demonstrating that static cosmologies were special cases requiring fine-tuning. His work, largely overlooked at the time, established the mathematical foundation for modern cosmological models. Friedmann died of typhoid fever in 1925, never seeing his solutions confirmed by observation. The Belgian priest and physicist Georges Lemaître independently derived similar solutions in 1927 and proposed that the universe had originated from a primeval atom, an early version of the Big Bang hypothesis.@@Edwin Hubble's observations at Mount Wilson Observatory in the 1920s provided the empirical foundation for modern cosmology. By identifying Cepheid variable stars in nearby galaxies, Hubble established that spiral nebulae were independent stellar systems far beyond the Milky Way, vastly expanding the known scale of the universe. His subsequent measurements of galaxy redshifts, combined with distance estimates, revealed the systematic recession of galaxies, with more distant objects receding faster. This relationship, now known as Hubble's law, provided direct observational evidence for the expanding universe that Friedmann and Lemaître had predicted.@@The expanding universe implied that it had been smaller and denser in the past, eventually leading to the concept of an initial singularity from which everything emerged. Georges Lemaître proposed in 1931 that the universe began as a primeval atom or cosmic egg that exploded, scattering matter throughout space. This hypothesis, later derisively termed the Big Bang by Fred Hoyle, who favored an alternative steady-state cosmology, gradually gained acceptance as evidence accumulated. The name stuck despite its misleading implications, as the event was neither an explosion in pre-existing space nor localized at a particular point.@@The steady-state theory, proposed by Hermann Bondi, Thomas Gold, and Fred Hoyle in 1948, offered an alternative to the Big Bang that maintained an eternal, unchanging universe on large scales. This model proposed continuous creation of matter to fill the voids left by cosmic expansion, preserving constant average density despite the expansion. The steady-state theory satisfied the perfect cosmological principle, which extended the standard cosmological principle to include time as well as space, asserting that the universe appears the same from any location at any time. Though ultimately falsified by observation, the steady-state theory stimulated important developments including the first detailed calculations of stellar nucleosynthesis.@@George Gamow and his collaborators Ralph Alpher and Robert Herman developed the physical theory of the hot Big Bang in the late 1940s, predicting that the early universe was hot and dense enough for nuclear reactions. Their calculations of primordial nucleosynthesis explained the cosmic abundances of light elements, particularly the roughly 75 percent hydrogen and 25 percent helium observed in the oldest stars. Alpher and Herman also predicted that a remnant glow from the hot early universe should still permeate space, cooled by cosmic expansion to a temperature of a few degrees above absolute zero. This prediction would be spectacularly confirmed seventeen years later.@@The discovery of the cosmic microwave background radiation by Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson in 1965 provided decisive evidence for the Big Bang and against the steady-state model. Working with a horn antenna at Bell Telephone Laboratories, they detected an isotropic microwave signal that could not be eliminated despite their best efforts to remove instrumental noise, including famously evicting pigeons nesting in the antenna. Theoretical cosmologists at nearby Princeton University, unaware of Penzias and Wilson's observations, were independently preparing to search for exactly this radiation. The serendipitous discovery, earning Penzias and Wilson the 1978 Nobel Prize, transformed cosmology from speculative philosophy into an observational science.@@The cosmic microwave background represents the oldest light in the universe, released approximately 380,000 years after the Big Bang when the cosmos cooled enough for electrons and protons to combine into neutral hydrogen atoms. Before this epoch of recombination, the universe was an opaque plasma of ions and electrons that scattered photons, preventing light from traveling freely. When neutral atoms formed, the universe became transparent, and the photons present at that moment have traveled freely ever since, their wavelengths stretched by cosmic expansion from visible light to microwaves. This surface of last scattering provides a snapshot of the universe's conditions when it was roughly 1,100 times smaller than today.@@The remarkable uniformity of the cosmic microwave background, with temperature variations of only one part in 100,000, presents both a triumph and a puzzle for cosmology. The uniformity confirms that the early universe was extraordinarily homogeneous and isotropic, consistent with the cosmological principle underlying theoretical models. However, this uniformity is difficult to explain in standard Big Bang cosmology, as regions on opposite sides of the sky were never in causal contact and thus had no opportunity to equilibrate. This horizon problem, along with related puzzles about the universe's geometry and the absence of exotic relics, motivated the development of inflationary cosmology.@@Cosmic inflation, proposed by Alan Guth in 1980, posits that the universe underwent a brief period of exponential expansion in its earliest moments, stretching by a factor of at least 10^26 in a tiny fraction of a second. This dramatic expansion would have smoothed out any initial inhomogeneities, explaining the observed uniformity of the microwave background, while also driving the spatial geometry toward flatness regardless of initial conditions. Inflation also explains why we observe no magnetic monopoles or other exotic relics predicted by grand unified theories: any such objects would have been diluted to negligible density by the expansion. Perhaps most remarkably, quantum fluctuations during inflation would have been stretched to cosmic scales, providing the seeds for all subsequent structure formation.@@The inflationary paradigm makes specific predictions about the statistical properties of primordial density fluctuations, which can be tested through precise measurements of the cosmic microwave background. Inflation predicts fluctuations that are nearly scale-invariant, meaning their amplitude is nearly the same on all length scales, and are Gaussian, meaning their statistical distribution follows a normal curve. These predictions have been confirmed to high precision by satellite missions including COBE, WMAP, and Planck. The slight deviation from perfect scale invariance, with larger scales having slightly larger fluctuations, matches inflationary predictions and provides evidence for the specific physics of the inflationary epoch.@@The Planck satellite, launched by the European Space Agency in 2009, provided the most precise full-sky maps of the cosmic microwave background to date, measuring temperature fluctuations with angular resolution of a few arcminutes and sensitivity of a few millionths of a degree. These observations confirmed the standard cosmological model with unprecedented precision, determining that the universe is 13.8 billion years old, geometrically flat to within 0.4 percent, and composed of approximately 5 percent ordinary matter, 27 percent dark matter, and 68 percent dark energy. The angular power spectrum of temperature fluctuations, showing characteristic peaks and troughs corresponding to acoustic oscillations in the primordial plasma, provides exquisite confirmation of theoretical predictions.@@The primordial density fluctuations revealed in the cosmic microwave background served as seeds for all cosmic structure, amplified over billions of years by gravitational instability. Slightly overdense regions attracted surrounding matter, becoming denser still, while underdense regions emptied as matter flowed toward the overdensities. This gravitational amplification eventually produced the cosmic web of galaxies, clusters, filaments, and voids observed today. Numerical simulations tracking this evolution from early fluctuations to present structure have achieved remarkable agreement with observations, validating the gravitational instability paradigm and constraining cosmological parameters.@@Dark matter, first inferred from galaxy cluster dynamics by Fritz Zwicky in 1933 and from galaxy rotation curves by Vera Rubin and Kent Ford in the 1970s, plays an essential role in cosmological structure formation. Ordinary matter alone cannot explain the observed patterns of galaxy clustering and the growth of structure from primordial fluctuations. Dark matter, interacting gravitationally but not electromagnetically, began collapsing into structures before ordinary matter could, creating the gravitational potential wells into which baryons later fell. This hierarchical scenario, with small structures forming first and merging into larger ones, successfully explains the observed distribution of galaxies and the properties of galaxy clusters.@@The nature of dark matter remains one of the most pressing unsolved problems in physics and cosmology. Leading candidates include weakly interacting massive particles, or WIMPs, arising in supersymmetric extensions of the standard model, and axions, hypothetical particles originally proposed to resolve a puzzle in quantum chromodynamics. Despite decades of experimental effort using underground detectors, accelerator searches, and astronomical observations, no dark matter particle has been definitively detected. Alternative theories modifying gravity rather than invoking invisible matter exist but face significant challenges explaining the full range of cosmological and astrophysical evidence.@@The discovery in 1998 that the expansion of the universe is accelerating rather than decelerating came as a profound shock to the cosmological community. Two independent teams studying Type Ia supernovae in distant galaxies found that these standard candles were fainter than expected, implying they were more distant than a decelerating universe would allow. This observation, earning Saul Perlmutter, Brian Schmidt, and Adam Riess the 2011 Nobel Prize, revealed that some form of dark energy with negative pressure is driving the cosmic expansion to accelerate. The simplest explanation identifies dark energy with Einstein's cosmological constant, but its required value is inexplicably tiny compared to theoretical expectations.@@The cosmological constant problem represents perhaps the most severe fine-tuning puzzle in all of physics, with theoretical estimates of vacuum energy exceeding the observed value by some 120 orders of magnitude. Quantum field theory predicts that empty space should have enormous energy density due to vacuum fluctuations, yet the observed dark energy density is vanishingly small by comparison. Various theoretical approaches have been proposed, including supersymmetry, which could partially cancel vacuum contributions, and anthropic selection in a multiverse, which might explain why we observe a value compatible with structure formation. No resolution has achieved consensus, leaving the cosmological constant problem as a major challenge for fundamental physics.@@Alternative explanations for cosmic acceleration invoke dynamical dark energy, often called quintessence, rather than a true cosmological constant. In these models, dark energy arises from a scalar field slowly rolling down its potential, with its energy density and equation of state potentially varying over cosmic time. Such variations could in principle be detected through precise measurements of the cosmic expansion history and the growth of structure. Current observations are consistent with a cosmological constant but do not definitively exclude dynamical dark energy, motivating future surveys designed to distinguish between these possibilities.@@Modified gravity theories attempt to explain cosmic acceleration without invoking dark energy by altering the laws of gravity on cosmological scales. Such modifications must reproduce the successes of general relativity in the solar system and other well-tested regimes while producing acceleration only on the largest scales. Various proposals have been made, including f(R) gravity, braneworld scenarios, and massive gravity, each with distinct observational signatures. Testing these alternatives requires precise measurements of both the expansion history and the growth of cosmic structure, which are differently affected by dark energy and modified gravity.@@The equation of state parameter w characterizes the relationship between pressure and energy density for any cosmological component, with w = -1 corresponding to a cosmological constant, w = 0 to matter, and w = 1/3 to radiation. Measurements of the cosmic expansion history constrain w and its possible time variation, providing tests of dark energy models. Current observations are consistent with w = -1 to within a few percent, but the uncertainties remain large enough to permit dynamical evolution. Future surveys aim to measure w with percent-level precision and detect any variation, potentially revealing the physical nature of dark energy.@@Baryon acoustic oscillations provide a standard ruler for measuring cosmic distances and the expansion history. Sound waves propagating through the hot plasma of the early universe were frozen in at recombination, leaving a characteristic scale of approximately 150 megaparsecs imprinted in the distribution of galaxies. This scale appears as a slight preference for galaxies to be separated by this distance, detectable in large redshift surveys. By measuring how this scale appears at different cosmic epochs, astronomers can trace the expansion history and constrain dark energy properties.@@Galaxy redshift surveys have mapped the three-dimensional distribution of millions of galaxies, revealing the cosmic web of structure and enabling precise cosmological measurements. The Sloan Digital Sky Survey, beginning observations in 2000, mapped over a million galaxies and detected baryon acoustic oscillations in the galaxy distribution. Subsequent surveys including BOSS and eBOSS have extended these measurements to earlier cosmic epochs. The Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument, which began operations in 2021, will map tens of millions of galaxies, providing the most precise baryon acoustic oscillation measurements to date.@@Weak gravitational lensing, the subtle distortion of background galaxy shapes by foreground matter, provides a powerful probe of both the expansion history and the growth of structure. Unlike galaxy surveys that trace the distribution of luminous matter, weak lensing is sensitive to all matter including dark matter, providing complementary information. Large imaging surveys measure the statistical correlation of galaxy shape distortions to map the matter distribution and its evolution. The combination of lensing with other probes can break degeneracies and provide precise tests of general relativity on cosmological scales.@@The Vera C. Rubin Observatory, under construction in Chile, will conduct the Legacy Survey of Space and Time, repeatedly imaging the entire southern sky for ten years. This survey will detect billions of galaxies suitable for weak lensing analysis, along with millions of Type Ia supernovae for distance measurements. The statistical power of this dataset will enable percent-level constraints on dark energy properties and sensitive tests of gravity. Combined with spectroscopic surveys and cosmic microwave background measurements, Rubin data will provide a comprehensive picture of cosmic evolution.@@The Hubble tension refers to the persistent discrepancy between different methods of measuring the current expansion rate, quantified by the Hubble constant H0. Measurements based on the cosmic microwave background and the standard cosmological model yield approximately 67 kilometers per second per megaparsec, while local distance ladder measurements using Cepheids and supernovae give approximately 73 kilometers per second per megaparsec. This roughly 10 percent discrepancy significantly exceeds the quoted uncertainties of either method, suggesting either unidentified systematic errors or new physics beyond the standard model. Resolution of this tension is a primary goal of current cosmological research.@@Various explanations for the Hubble tension have been proposed, ranging from mundane systematic errors to exotic new physics. Proposed systematic effects include errors in Cepheid or supernova calibrations, unrecognized variations in supernova properties with redshift, or contamination in cosmic microwave background analyses. New physics proposals include early dark energy that briefly accelerates the expansion before recombination, additional relativistic species in the early universe, or modifications to gravity. No single explanation has gained consensus acceptance, and the tension remains one of the most actively debated topics in cosmology.@@The growth of cosmic structure provides tests of gravity that complement expansion history measurements. In general relativity, the rate at which density perturbations grow is determined by the expansion rate and the matter content, so measurements of both the expansion and growth can test whether gravity behaves as expected. Observations of galaxy clusters, weak lensing, and redshift-space distortions all probe structure growth. Current measurements are broadly consistent with general relativity, though some analyses suggest a slight suppression of growth relative to predictions, potentially hinting at new physics.@@Primordial gravitational waves, produced during inflation, would leave a distinctive signature in the polarization of the cosmic microwave background called B-modes. The amplitude of these gravitational waves depends on the energy scale of inflation, so their detection would provide a direct probe of physics at energies far beyond any particle accelerator. Initial claims of B-mode detection by the BICEP2 experiment in 2014 were later attributed to dust contamination, and subsequent searches have placed increasingly stringent upper limits. Future experiments including ground-based observatories and proposed satellite missions continue the search.@@The cosmic microwave background polarization contains rich information beyond the B-mode gravitational wave signature. E-mode polarization, already detected, arises from the same density fluctuations that produce temperature anisotropies and provides complementary constraints on cosmological parameters. The correlation between temperature and E-mode polarization confirms the standard model of cosmological perturbations. Measurements of polarization at high multipoles probe the reionization epoch when the first stars ionized the intergalactic medium, constraining this poorly understood period of cosmic history.@@Big Bang nucleosynthesis describes the formation of light elements during the first few minutes of cosmic history, when temperatures were high enough for nuclear reactions but low enough for nuclei to survive. The predicted abundances of deuterium, helium-3, helium-4, and lithium-7 depend sensitively on the baryon-to-photon ratio, which can be independently measured from the cosmic microwave background. The remarkable agreement between nucleosynthesis predictions and observed primordial abundances for deuterium and helium-4 provides strong evidence for the hot Big Bang model. A discrepancy for lithium-7, with observations showing less than predicted, remains an unresolved puzzle.@@The baryon density determined from Big Bang nucleosynthesis and from the cosmic microwave background are in excellent agreement, both indicating that ordinary baryonic matter comprises only about 5 percent of the total cosmic energy density. This concordance between two completely independent methods, one probing conditions seconds after the Big Bang and the other probing 380,000 years later, represents a remarkable validation of the standard cosmological model. The consistency also rules out exotic nucleosynthesis scenarios and constrains the properties of any particles that might have been present in the early universe.@@The matter-antimatter asymmetry of the universe presents a fundamental cosmological puzzle. The observed universe is composed almost entirely of matter rather than antimatter, yet the fundamental laws of physics as currently understood treat matter and antimatter nearly symmetrically. Andrei Sakharov identified three conditions necessary for generating a baryon asymmetry from an initially symmetric state: baryon number violation, C and CP violation, and departure from thermal equilibrium. While the standard model of particle physics contains the necessary ingredients, the magnitude of CP violation appears insufficient to explain the observed asymmetry, suggesting physics beyond the standard model.@@Baryogenesis theories attempt to explain how the matter-antimatter asymmetry arose in the early universe. Electroweak baryogenesis proposes that the asymmetry was generated during the electroweak phase transition, when the Higgs field acquired its present value, though this mechanism appears insufficient in the standard model. Grand unified theories offer alternative scenarios where baryon number violation occurs at extremely high energies. Leptogenesis proposes that an asymmetry was first generated in the lepton sector and later converted to a baryon asymmetry through standard model processes. The correct mechanism remains unknown, representing an important open question at the intersection of cosmology and particle physics.@@Phase transitions in the early universe may have left observable relics detectable today. The electroweak phase transition, occurring when the universe was about a picosecond old, may have produced gravitational waves detectable by future space-based observatories if the transition was strongly first-order. The QCD phase transition, when quarks and gluons became confined into hadrons at about a microsecond, may have affected primordial nucleosynthesis and produced density fluctuations. Cosmic strings, topological defects potentially formed during phase transitions in grand unified theories, could produce distinctive gravitational wave signatures and contribute to structure formation.@@The inflationary epoch, while solving several cosmological puzzles, remains incompletely understood in terms of fundamental physics. The scalar field driving inflation, called the inflaton, has not been identified with any known particle, and its potential energy function is only loosely constrained by observations. Hundreds of inflationary models have been proposed, differing in the form of the inflaton potential, the number of fields involved, and the mechanism ending inflation. While all successful models share the prediction of nearly scale-invariant, Gaussian perturbations, they differ in detailed predictions for non-Gaussianity, gravitational waves, and other observables.@@Eternal inflation, a consequence of many inflationary models, suggests that inflation never completely ends but continues indefinitely in some regions while pocket universes like our own nucleate and evolve. This scenario leads naturally to the concept of a multiverse, an ensemble of causally disconnected regions with potentially different physical properties. The multiverse hypothesis has profound implications for cosmology and physics, potentially explaining apparent fine-tuning through anthropic selection, but it also raises deep questions about testability and the nature of scientific explanation. Critics argue that invoking unobservable universes to explain observations represents a departure from empirical science.@@The anthropic principle, in various formulations, connects the observed properties of the universe to the requirements for observers to exist. In its weak form, the principle merely notes that we can only observe a universe compatible with our existence, a logical tautology with no predictive content. Stronger formulations, particularly when combined with a multiverse, attempt to explain apparent fine-tuning by noting that only universes with suitable properties would contain observers to ask the question. The cosmological constant, whose value is inexplicably small but not zero, is often cited as a potential anthropic prediction, as much larger values would prevent structure formation.@@The measure problem in eternal inflation concerns how to assign probabilities to observations in an infinite multiverse. Since eternal inflation produces infinitely many pocket universes of each type, naive counting leads to ambiguous or paradoxical results depending on how the infinite ensemble is regulated. Various measures have been proposed, each with different implications for the predicted frequency of different observations. This technical problem has profound implications for whether the multiverse can make testable predictions, as different measures can lead to different predictions for observable quantities.@@The string theory landscape refers to the vast number of possible vacuum states in string theory, estimated at 10^500 or more, each potentially corresponding to a different universe with different physical properties. Combined with eternal inflation, which can populate this landscape, this scenario suggests a multiverse where different regions have different effective physical laws. The landscape has been invoked to explain the smallness of the cosmological constant through anthropic selection, though critics question whether such explanations have scientific content. Whether string theory actually predicts a landscape remains debated, as does whether the landscape, if real, undermines or supports the prospects for fundamental physics.@@Quantum cosmology attempts to apply quantum mechanics to the universe as a whole, addressing questions about the origin of the universe and the nature of time. The Wheeler-DeWitt equation, the analog of the Schrödinger equation for gravity, describes the quantum state of the universe but faces severe interpretational challenges, including the problem of time: in quantum gravity, there is no external time parameter, yet time evolution is central to conventional quantum mechanics. Various approaches have been proposed, including the Hartle-Hawking no-boundary proposal and Vilenkin's tunneling from nothing, but no consensus exists on how quantum mechanics applies to cosmology.@@The origin of time and the universe before the Big Bang remain deeply mysterious, perhaps representing limits of scientific explanation. Classical general relativity predicts a singularity at the Big Bang where spacetime curvature becomes infinite and the theory breaks down. Quantum gravity effects are expected to become important near the Planck time of 10^-43 seconds, potentially resolving the singularity, but no complete theory of quantum gravity exists. Some proposals, including ekpyrotic and cyclic models, suggest our Big Bang resulted from a collision of higher-dimensional branes, with time potentially extending infinitely into the past through repeated cycles.@@The arrow of time, the fact that time appears to flow in one direction from past to future, is intimately connected to cosmological initial conditions. The second law of thermodynamics, stating that entropy increases over time, requires that the universe began in a state of extraordinarily low entropy, an initial condition not explained by the laws of physics themselves. Cosmological inflation may help explain this by dynamically preparing a smooth, low-entropy initial state, though the origin of the inflationary initial conditions remains unclear. Understanding why the Big Bang had such special initial conditions represents a frontier of cosmological thought.@@The ultimate fate of the universe depends on its composition and the behavior of dark energy over cosmic time. If dark energy is a cosmological constant, the universe will expand forever, with galaxies outside our local supercluster eventually receding beyond the cosmic horizon and disappearing from view. The remaining isolated island of matter will slowly run down as stars burn out and matter decays, approaching a state of maximum entropy called heat death. On truly astronomical timescales of 10^100 years or more, even black holes will evaporate through Hawking radiation, leaving only a cold, dilute gas of elementary particles.@@Alternative cosmological scenarios predict different ultimate fates, though current observations favor eternal expansion. If dark energy could become negative, the universe might recollapse in a Big Crunch, potentially oscillating through repeated cycles. If dark energy increases over time, phantom dark energy with w < -1 could cause a Big Rip in which the accelerating expansion eventually tears apart galaxies, stars, planets, and even atoms. While these scenarios are currently disfavored by observations, our understanding of dark energy remains insufficient to definitively predict the cosmic future.@@Black hole thermodynamics, pioneered by Jacob Bekenstein and Stephen Hawking in the 1970s, revealed deep connections between gravity, quantum mechanics, and thermodynamics with cosmological implications. Bekenstein proposed that black holes have entropy proportional to their event horizon area, while Hawking showed that black holes emit thermal radiation and slowly evaporate. These discoveries suggested that the laws of thermodynamics apply even to gravitational systems, with profound implications for the ultimate fate of information falling into black holes and for the nature of spacetime itself.@@The holographic principle, inspired by black hole thermodynamics, proposes that the information content of any region of space is encoded on its boundary rather than in its volume. This counterintuitive idea suggests that our apparently three-dimensional universe may be equivalent to a two-dimensional theory on a distant boundary. The AdS/CFT correspondence, discovered by Juan Maldacena in 1997, provides a precise realization of holography in certain theoretical contexts. While its applicability to our universe remains unclear, holography has profoundly influenced approaches to quantum gravity and cosmology.@@The information paradox in black hole physics raises fundamental questions about quantum mechanics, gravity, and the nature of physical law. If black holes evaporate completely through Hawking radiation, as Hawking's original calculation suggested, then information about what fell into the black hole appears to be lost, violating the unitarity of quantum mechanics. Various resolutions have been proposed, including black hole remnants, firewalls at the event horizon, and subtle correlations in the Hawking radiation. Recent work on the Page curve and quantum extremal surfaces suggests that information is preserved but encoded in subtle ways, though complete understanding remains elusive.@@Observational cosmology has advanced dramatically through space-based observatories operating across the electromagnetic spectrum. The Hubble Space Telescope has provided deep images revealing galaxy evolution over cosmic time, while the Spitzer and James Webb Space Telescopes have probed the infrared universe including the first galaxies and the cosmic infrared background. The Chandra X-ray Observatory has mapped the hot gas in galaxy clusters, constraining cosmological parameters through cluster abundance measurements. Each wavelength regime provides unique cosmological information, and the combination of multi-wavelength data has proven especially powerful.@@The James Webb Space Telescope, launched in December 2021, has already transformed our understanding of the early universe. Its infrared sensitivity enables detection of galaxies at redshifts exceeding 10, when the universe was less than 500 million years old. Early observations revealed unexpectedly bright and massive galaxies at these early times, challenging some theoretical expectations for early galaxy formation. Webb observations of the cosmic infrared background, galaxy clustering, and gravitational lensing will provide new constraints on cosmological parameters and the physics of the early universe.@@Gravitational wave astronomy, inaugurated by LIGO's first detection in 2015, provides a new window on the cosmos complementary to electromagnetic observations. Binary black hole and neutron star mergers produce gravitational waves detectable by ground-based interferometers, enabling measurements of merger rates, mass distributions, and cosmic expansion. Future space-based observatories like LISA will detect supermassive black hole mergers and potentially primordial gravitational waves from inflation. Pulsar timing arrays have recently detected the stochastic gravitational wave background from supermassive black hole binaries, probing black hole growth and galaxy evolution.@@Gravitational waves can serve as standard sirens for measuring cosmic distances, providing an independent determination of the Hubble constant free from calibration issues affecting traditional methods. The merger of two neutron stars detected in 2017, accompanied by electromagnetic counterparts that identified the host galaxy and its redshift, provided the first standard siren measurement of H0. Future detections will improve precision, potentially resolving the Hubble tension if it results from systematic errors in traditional methods. The combination of gravitational wave and electromagnetic observations exemplifies the power of multi-messenger astronomy.@@The epoch of reionization, when ultraviolet radiation from the first stars and galaxies ionized the intergalactic medium, represents a major phase transition in cosmic history. Before reionization, neutral hydrogen pervading the universe absorbed light at wavelengths shorter than the Lyman-alpha line, creating a cosmic dark age. The process of reionization was patchy and extended, beginning perhaps 200 million years after the Big Bang and completing by about one billion years. Understanding reionization requires identifying the sources of ionizing radiation, likely early galaxies and possibly quasars, and modeling how ionized regions grew and merged.@@The 21-centimeter line of neutral hydrogen provides a unique probe of the dark ages and reionization epoch inaccessible to other techniques. Neutral hydrogen atoms can absorb or emit radio waves at this wavelength through hyperfine transitions, and observations of this line against the cosmic microwave background can reveal the distribution and ionization state of hydrogen during reionization. Several radio telescope arrays are attempting to detect this signal, though foreground contamination from our galaxy presents formidable challenges. Detection of 21-centimeter fluctuations would open a new window on early cosmic history.@@The first stars, called Population III stars, likely formed from pristine primordial gas lacking heavy elements approximately 100 to 200 million years after the Big Bang. Theoretical models suggest these stars were very massive, perhaps hundreds of solar masses, because the absence of heavy elements prevented efficient gas cooling and fragmentation. Such massive stars would have lived briefly and died as supernovae or direct-collapse black holes, seeding the universe with the first heavy elements and potentially planting the seeds of supermassive black holes. No Population III star has been directly observed, but their signatures might be detectable in the most distant galaxies or the chemical abundances of ancient stars.@@The cosmic star formation history describes how the rate of new star formation has varied over cosmic time, rising from the first stars through a peak around redshift 2 when the universe was about 3 billion years old, then declining to the present. This history is traced through surveys of star-forming galaxies at different redshifts, measurements of the cosmic infrared background, and observations of supernovae. The decline in star formation rate over the past 10 billion years reflects the consumption of gas fuel and the shutdown of gas accretion in massive galaxies. Understanding what regulates star formation across cosmic time remains an active research area.@@Galaxy clusters, the largest gravitationally bound structures in the universe, serve as powerful cosmological probes through their abundance, spatial distribution, and gas properties. The number of clusters as a function of mass and redshift depends sensitively on cosmological parameters, particularly the matter density and the amplitude of density fluctuations. Hot intracluster gas, observed through X-ray emission and the Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect on the cosmic microwave background, provides additional information about cluster masses and cosmology. Cluster surveys at X-ray, optical, and millimeter wavelengths have contributed significantly to cosmological parameter constraints.@@The Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect occurs when cosmic microwave background photons scatter off hot electrons in galaxy clusters, creating a distinctive spectral distortion. In the thermal effect, photons are shifted to higher frequencies, creating a decrement at low frequencies and an increment at high frequencies relative to the background. This effect is independent of redshift, making it valuable for detecting distant clusters and studying cluster physics. The kinetic effect, arising from the bulk motion of clusters, produces a frequency-independent temperature shift that can probe peculiar velocities and test cosmology.@@Cosmic voids, the underdense regions between filaments and clusters in the cosmic web, have emerged as valuable cosmological probes. Voids are less affected by complex baryonic physics than overdense regions, making them cleaner laboratories for testing gravity and dark energy. The abundance, sizes, and shapes of voids contain cosmological information complementary to that from clusters and galaxies. Void-galaxy correlations and weak lensing by voids have been used to measure dark energy properties and test modified gravity theories. Large galaxy surveys now routinely identify and catalog voids for cosmological analysis.@@Intensity mapping offers a technique for surveying large cosmic volumes efficiently by measuring aggregate emission from many unresolved sources rather than detecting individual objects. By mapping fluctuations in the 21-centimeter line, carbon monoxide, or other spectral features across the sky, intensity mapping can trace the distribution of matter and measure baryon acoustic oscillations at high redshifts. Current and planned experiments aim to demonstrate the technique and provide competitive cosmological constraints. Intensity mapping may prove especially valuable for probing the epoch of reionization and the cosmic dark ages.@@Cross-correlations between different cosmological observables can extract information beyond what each probe provides individually and test for systematic errors. For example, correlating galaxy positions with weak lensing shear tests galaxy bias models and constrains cosmological parameters. Cross-correlating cosmic microwave background lensing with galaxy surveys provides independent measurements of structure growth. Finding consistent results from multiple cross-correlations builds confidence in the standard cosmological model, while discrepancies might reveal new physics or systematic errors.@@Tension between different cosmological datasets, beyond the well-publicized Hubble tension, may hint at inconsistencies in the standard model. Some analyses suggest that the amplitude of matter fluctuations inferred from the cosmic microwave background exceeds that measured from low-redshift probes like weak lensing and cluster counts. While the statistical significance of this discrepancy remains debated and systematic errors may be responsible, persistent tension could indicate new physics affecting structure growth. Resolving these tensions is a major goal of current and future surveys.@@The Dark Energy Survey, using a 570-megapixel camera on the Blanco telescope in Chile, has mapped 5,000 square degrees of the southern sky to unprecedented depth, detecting hundreds of millions of galaxies for weak lensing analysis, thousands of Type Ia supernovae, and tens of thousands of galaxy clusters. The resulting cosmological constraints from weak lensing, galaxy clustering, and their cross-correlations have achieved precision comparable to Planck, providing an independent test of the standard model. Final analysis of the complete dataset will provide the most precise low-redshift cosmological measurements to date.@@The Euclid space telescope, launched by the European Space Agency in 2023, will survey 15,000 square degrees of the extragalactic sky in optical and near-infrared wavelengths, measuring shapes of billions of galaxies for weak lensing and redshifts of tens of millions of galaxies for baryon acoustic oscillations. These measurements will constrain dark energy properties to percent-level precision and test gravity on cosmological scales. Euclid's combination of area, depth, and wavelength coverage is optimized for dark energy science, complementing ground-based surveys.@@The Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope, scheduled for launch in the mid-2020s, will conduct complementary cosmological surveys with higher resolution than Euclid and different wavelength coverage. Its supernova survey will detect thousands of Type Ia supernovae to high redshift with unprecedented photometric precision, constraining the dark energy equation of state. Roman's high-latitude survey will enable weak lensing measurements at small scales inaccessible from the ground. Together, Euclid and Roman will provide transformative cosmological constraints.@@Machine learning and artificial intelligence are increasingly applied to cosmological data analysis, addressing challenges from galaxy classification to parameter inference. Neural networks can learn to extract cosmological information from weak lensing maps, bypassing traditional two-point statistics that discard non-Gaussian information. Simulation-based inference techniques train networks on simulated data to perform Bayesian inference on observations, enabling analysis of complex data without explicit likelihood functions. These methods are particularly valuable for upcoming surveys producing datasets too large and complex for traditional analysis.@@Cosmological simulations have achieved remarkable fidelity in reproducing observed cosmic structure, from the cosmic web on the largest scales to the properties of individual galaxies. The Illustris, Eagle, and IllustrisTNG simulations incorporate gas dynamics, star formation, black hole growth, and feedback processes, producing galaxy populations that match observations in many respects. These simulations serve as theoretical laboratories for understanding galaxy formation and as training sets for interpreting observations. Limitations in resolution and uncertain subgrid physics remain challenges, addressed through larger simulations and improved physical modeling.@@The cosmic microwave background spectral distortions represent a frontier for precision cosmology, encoding information about energy release in the early universe. Perfect blackbody radiation is established only before a redshift of about two million; energy injection afterward produces characteristic distortions detectable in principle with sensitive spectrometers. Proposed space missions like PIXIE would measure these distortions, probing the thermal history of the early universe and potentially detecting signals from the decay or annihilation of exotic particles. While no spectral distortions have yet been detected beyond the Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect, future observations may open this new observational window.@@Gravitational lensing of the cosmic microwave background, caused by matter along the line of sight between the surface of last scattering and the observer, has emerged as a powerful cosmological probe. The characteristic pattern of lensing distortions can be extracted from microwave background maps, providing a measure of the integrated matter distribution to high redshift. Cosmic microwave background lensing has been detected with high significance by Planck, ACT, and SPT, and the measurements constrain cosmological parameters including the sum of neutrino masses. Cross-correlation of CMB lensing with galaxy surveys provides additional cosmological information.@@Neutrino masses, while tiny, have significant cosmological effects because neutrinos are so abundant. The three known neutrino flavors collectively comprise at least 0.1 percent of the cosmic energy density, affecting the cosmic microwave background and suppressing the growth of structure on small scales. Cosmological observations currently provide the tightest upper limits on the sum of neutrino masses, with constraints from Planck and other data requiring this sum to be less than about 0.12 electron volts. Future surveys may detect the minimum mass required by neutrino oscillation experiments, providing complementary information to laboratory measurements.@@The matter power spectrum, describing how matter density fluctuations vary with scale, encodes fundamental cosmological information accessible through galaxy surveys, weak lensing, and other probes. The shape of the power spectrum reveals the balance between dark matter and ordinary matter, the expansion history affecting how fluctuations grow, and any modifications to gravity. Precise measurements across a wide range of scales, from the largest cosmic structures to galaxy halos, constrain cosmological models and search for deviations from general relativity. Nonlinear evolution on small scales requires sophisticated theoretical modeling and simulations to interpret.@@Cosmic homogeneity and isotropy, the cosmological principle underlying standard models, can be tested through observations of the large-scale universe. While the cosmic microwave background demonstrates extraordinary isotropy, the matter distribution shows significant structure on scales of hundreds of megaparsecs. Statistical tests confirm that the universe becomes homogeneous when averaged over sufficiently large volumes, but claims of structures exceeding the expected homogeneity scale periodically appear and require careful evaluation. The cosmological principle remains well supported but is ultimately an empirical question subject to observational test.@@The curvature of space, a fundamental property distinguishing different cosmological geometries, is measured to be consistent with flatness to remarkable precision. Planck observations constrain the spatial curvature to within 0.4 percent of flat, confirming a prediction of inflation. However, some analyses suggest slight positive curvature that would have significant implications if confirmed. Future observations, particularly cosmic microwave background measurements on large angular scales and more precise distance ladder calibrations, may resolve whether the universe is precisely flat or has small positive or negative curvature.@@The initial conditions for cosmic structure, now precisely characterized through cosmic microwave background observations, constrain the physics of inflation and alternatives. The scalar spectral index, measuring the scale dependence of primordial fluctuations, is measured to differ from unity at high significance, as predicted by inflation. The running of the spectral index, describing how the spectral index itself varies with scale, is consistent with zero but with sufficient uncertainty to allow significant running in some inflationary models. These precision measurements rule out many inflationary models while remaining consistent with large classes of others.@@Non-Gaussianity in the primordial fluctuations, deviations from the Gaussian statistical distribution predicted by simple inflationary models, would provide powerful discriminating information about the physics of inflation. Different inflationary mechanisms predict different forms and amplitudes of non-Gaussianity. Planck observations have placed tight constraints on several forms of non-Gaussianity, ruling out some multi-field and non-standard inflationary scenarios. Future cosmic microwave background observations and large-scale structure surveys may achieve the sensitivity needed to detect the small non-Gaussianity predicted by standard single-field inflation.@@Isocurvature perturbations, fluctuations in the relative abundances of different particle species rather than in total density, would indicate complex dynamics during inflation involving multiple fields. While standard single-field inflation produces purely adiabatic perturbations, models with additional light scalars can generate isocurvature modes with distinctive signatures in the cosmic microwave background. Planck observations constrain the amplitude of isocurvature perturbations to be small compared to the adiabatic component, limiting contributions from axions or other fields present during inflation. These constraints inform both inflationary model building and particle physics.@@The topology of the universe, whether space is simply connected like a sphere or multiply connected like a torus, affects observable patterns in the cosmic microwave background. In a finite, multiply connected universe, photons could travel around the universe multiple times, creating correlated patterns in the CMB temperature distribution. Searches for such patterns in WMAP and Planck data have found no evidence for non-trivial topology on scales smaller than the observable universe. While the universe may still have non-trivial topology on larger scales, current observations are consistent with simple, infinite spatial extent.@@Dark matter halos, the gravitational scaffolding within which galaxies form and reside, are predicted by simulations to have characteristic density profiles and substructure. The NFW profile, named for its discoverers Navarro, Frenk, and White, describes the average density distribution in halos, with density increasing steeply toward the center. Observations of galaxy rotation curves and stellar dynamics provide tests of these predictions, with some discrepancies potentially indicating problems with dark matter simulations or pointing toward alternative dark matter models. The interplay between simulations and observations continues to refine our understanding of halo structure.@@Ultra-light axion-like particles, sometimes called fuzzy dark matter, represent an alternative to conventional cold dark matter that could affect cosmological observables. With masses around 10^-22 electron volts, such particles would have de Broglie wavelengths comparable to galaxy sizes, suppressing small-scale structure and potentially explaining some discrepancies between simulations and observations on galactic scales. Constraints from the Lyman-alpha forest, galaxy luminosity functions, and reionization observations place limits on the fuzzy dark matter fraction. While not ruling out such particles entirely, current constraints suggest they cannot dominate the dark matter density.@@Primordial black holes, hypothetical black holes formed in the early universe rather than from stellar collapse, have been proposed as dark matter candidates. Various formation mechanisms have been suggested, including inflation-generated density fluctuations, phase transitions, and cosmic string loops. Observational constraints from gravitational lensing, dynamical effects, accretion radiation, and gravitational wave mergers severely limit the allowed mass range and abundance of primordial black holes. While they likely cannot constitute all of dark matter, primordial black holes in certain mass ranges remain viable and could contribute to observed gravitational wave events.@@Self-interacting dark matter, particles that scatter off each other with significant cross-sections while remaining invisible to ordinary matter, has been proposed to address potential small-scale structure problems. Such interactions could reduce central densities in dark matter halos, potentially explaining observed cores in dwarf galaxies where simulations predict cusps. Strong constraints on self-interaction cross-sections come from observations of galaxy cluster mergers, where dark matter halos pass through each other relatively unimpeded. The viable parameter space is constrained but not eliminated, and self-interacting dark matter remains an active research area.@@Warm dark matter, particles with velocities high enough to erase small-scale structure through free streaming in the early universe, represents another alternative to standard cold dark matter. Constraints from the Lyman-alpha forest, reionization history, and dwarf galaxy counts limit warm dark matter particle masses, excluding thermal relics lighter than a few keV. Sterile neutrinos, hypothetical right-handed neutrinos with masses in the keV range, remain viable warm dark matter candidates with potential astrophysical signatures in X-ray observations. The detection of a 3.5 keV line in some X-ray observations has been suggested as a sterile neutrino signal, though its interpretation remains controversial.@@Modified Newtonian dynamics, or MOND, proposed by Mordehai Milgrom in 1983, attempts to explain galaxy rotation curves without dark matter by modifying gravity at very low accelerations. While successful at fitting galaxy rotation curves with a single parameter, MOND struggles to explain galaxy cluster dynamics, the cosmic microwave background, and structure formation without invoking some form of dark matter. Relativistic extensions of MOND, such as tensor-vector-scalar gravity, have been developed but face their own challenges. MOND remains a minority viewpoint in cosmology, though its empirical success in galaxies continues to demand explanation.@@The cosmic web, the network of filaments, walls, clusters, and voids characterizing the large-scale matter distribution, has been mapped through galaxy redshift surveys and reconstructed from simulations. Galaxies form and evolve within this cosmic scaffolding, with their properties influenced by their environment: galaxies in dense cluster cores differ systematically from those in filaments or voids. Understanding how environment affects galaxy evolution requires tracing the assembly history of the cosmic web and the flow of matter through it. Large-volume simulations combined with extensive observations are revealing these connections.@@Intracluster light, diffuse stellar emission between galaxies in clusters, traces the dynamical history of cluster assembly through tidal stripping and galaxy disruption. This component, comprising perhaps 10 to 40 percent of the total cluster stellar mass, reveals the violent processes that shape galaxy clusters over cosmic time. Observations of intracluster light constrain cluster mass profiles and the efficiency of tidal stripping, while its colors and spatial distribution encode information about the stellar populations involved. Deep imaging with space and ground-based telescopes is revealing intracluster light in increasing detail.@@Cosmic magnetism, the presence of magnetic fields throughout the universe from galaxies to clusters to the intergalactic medium, has cosmological implications and uncertain origins. Magnetic fields in galaxies and clusters are relatively well observed, with typical strengths of microgauss and ordered structures on kpc to Mpc scales. The origin of these fields remains debated, with possibilities including primordial generation in the early universe and astrophysical amplification of weak seed fields. Constraints on intergalactic magnetic fields from gamma-ray observations and Faraday rotation inform models of cosmic magnetism.@@The Lyman-alpha forest, the absorption features seen in quasar spectra due to intervening neutral hydrogen, provides a unique probe of the intergalactic medium and cosmological structure. The statistical properties of Lyman-alpha absorption encode information about the matter power spectrum on small scales, the thermal history of the intergalactic medium, and the epoch of reionization. Measurements from large quasar surveys constrain the sum of neutrino masses, warm dark matter properties, and the amplitude of small-scale density fluctuations. Interpreting the Lyman-alpha forest requires sophisticated hydrodynamical simulations to model gas physics.@@High-redshift quasars probe the universe during and shortly after the epoch of reionization, providing information about early structure formation and intergalactic conditions. The most distant known quasars, at redshifts exceeding 7, existed when the universe was less than 800 million years old, yet harbor supermassive black holes of billions of solar masses. The existence of such massive black holes so early in cosmic history challenges theoretical models of black hole growth and informs our understanding of the first quasars and galaxies. Absorption spectra of these quasars reveal the ionization state of the intergalactic medium during reionization.@@Cosmological constraints from the cosmic distance ladder require understanding potential systematic errors at each rung. The foundation is geometric parallax from Gaia, extending to distances of kiloparsecs for stars in our galaxy. Cepheid variables calibrated by parallax extend measurements to tens of megaparsecs, reaching galaxies hosting Type Ia supernovae. The supernovae then extend to cosmological distances. At each step, potential systematic errors including dust extinction, metallicity effects, and population variations must be carefully addressed. The Hubble tension may ultimately be resolved through improved understanding of these systematics.@@The tip of the red giant branch provides an alternative to Cepheids for calibrating the distance ladder, with potentially different systematic uncertainties. As low-mass stars exhaust their core hydrogen and ascend the red giant branch, they reach a maximum luminosity before undergoing the helium flash. This tip luminosity is relatively constant and can serve as a distance indicator independent of Cepheid calibration. Measurements using this technique have yielded Hubble constant values intermediate between Cepheid-based and CMB-based determinations, though with larger uncertainties. Understanding the agreement or disagreement between different distance indicators is crucial for resolving the Hubble tension.@@Time-delay cosmography uses strongly lensed quasars, where multiple images arrive at different times due to path length differences, to measure the Hubble constant independently of the local distance ladder. The time delay between image variations depends on the Hubble constant and the lens mass distribution. The H0LiCOW collaboration has measured H0 from several lens systems, obtaining values consistent with the local distance ladder and in tension with Planck. Systematics from lens mass modeling represent the primary uncertainty, requiring careful attention to the mass distribution along the line of sight.@@Megamaser cosmology provides another independent Hubble constant measurement using water masers orbiting supermassive black holes in galaxy nuclei. By measuring both the angular size and physical velocity of the maser disk, geometric distances can be determined directly, bypassing the need for standard candles. The Megamaser Cosmology Project has measured distances to several galaxies, obtaining a Hubble constant consistent with other local determinations. Statistical precision is limited by the rarity of suitable maser sources, but the technique provides an important cross-check on systematic errors affecting other methods.@@The legacy of modern cosmology includes not only scientific knowledge but also a transformed human perspective on our place in the universe. We now know with precision the age, size, and composition of the observable universe, the history of cosmic evolution from the first fraction of a second to the present, and the large-scale structure that emerged from quantum fluctuations stretched to cosmic scales. Yet fundamental questions remain: the nature of dark matter and dark energy, the physics of the very early universe, and whether our cosmos is unique or one of many. These questions will occupy cosmologists for generations to come.@@The standard model of cosmology, sometimes called Lambda-CDM for its dominant components of cosmological constant (Lambda) and cold dark matter (CDM), has survived decades of increasingly precise tests. Its six fundamental parameters, determined from the cosmic microwave background, suffice to describe observations across an enormous range of scales and cosmic epochs. This economy of description represents a remarkable scientific achievement, though the physical nature of most cosmic constituents remains unknown. Whether Lambda-CDM represents the final word or an approximation to deeper physics remains to be seen.@@Future cosmological surveys will provide dramatic improvements in statistical precision, enabling more sensitive tests of the standard model and searches for new physics. The challenge increasingly lies in controlling systematic errors, both observational and theoretical, at the level required to match statistical power. This requires advances in detector technology, survey strategy, data analysis methods, and theoretical modeling. The interdisciplinary nature of modern cosmology, drawing on physics, astronomy, statistics, and computer science, reflects the complexity of these challenges.@@Cosmology occupies a unique position among the sciences, addressing questions about the totality of physical existence that have occupied human thought since antiquity. The progress from mythological cosmogonies through philosophical speculation to precise observational science represents one of the great achievements of human intellectual history. Yet the deepest questions remain open: why is there something rather than nothing, what is the nature of dark matter and dark energy, did our universe arise from something prior, and are we alone in the cosmos? These questions, refined by centuries of inquiry, continue to drive cosmological research forward.@@The next decades promise continued discovery and perhaps revolutionary transformation of our cosmic understanding. New telescopes and surveys will probe earlier cosmic epochs, higher redshifts, and smaller scales with unprecedented precision. Gravitational wave observatories will map the population of compact objects throughout cosmic history. Particle physics experiments may discover dark matter or reveal new phenomena at high energies. The interplay between observation, theory, and experiment that has driven cosmological progress will continue, potentially resolving current puzzles while inevitably raising new questions. The cosmos retains its capacity to surprise and inspire, rewarding those who devote their efforts to understanding it.@@The Friedmann equations, derived from Einstein's field equations under assumptions of homogeneity and isotropy, govern the evolution of the cosmic scale factor that describes how distances expand over time. The first Friedmann equation relates the expansion rate to the energy densities of matter, radiation, and dark energy, while the second describes how the expansion accelerates or decelerates depending on the equation of state of the dominant component. These equations, combined with the equation of state for each cosmic constituent, form a closed system that can be solved to predict the expansion history. The remarkable agreement between these predictions and observations spanning from nucleosynthesis to the present day represents one of the great triumphs of theoretical cosmology.@@The deceleration parameter q measures whether the cosmic expansion is speeding up or slowing down, with negative values indicating acceleration and positive values indicating deceleration. In a matter-dominated universe without dark energy, gravity causes deceleration with q = 0.5, while a cosmological-constant-dominated universe accelerates with q approaching -1. The transition from deceleration to acceleration occurred roughly five billion years ago when dark energy began to dominate over matter. This transition redshift, observed through supernova distances, provides important constraints on the dark energy density and equation of state.@@The coincidence problem asks why we happen to live at the cosmic epoch when dark energy and matter densities are comparable, despite their very different scaling with cosmic expansion. Matter density decreases as the cube of the scale factor as the universe expands, while cosmological constant density remains constant, so their ratio changes enormously over cosmic history. The fact that we observe them to be within a factor of a few of each other today seems to require either remarkable coincidence or some physical mechanism linking them. Attempts to address this coincidence motivate various dark energy models and anthropic considerations.@@Quintessence models invoke a slowly evolving scalar field to explain dark energy, potentially addressing the coincidence problem through tracking behavior where the field energy density follows that of the dominant component. In such models, the dark energy equation of state can vary over cosmic time, differing from the constant w = -1 of a cosmological constant. The potential energy function of the quintessence field determines its dynamics, with different potentials producing different observational signatures. Distinguishing quintessence from a cosmological constant requires measuring time variation in w with high precision, a goal of current and future surveys.@@The cosmic coincidence between the observed vacuum energy and the energy scale of neutrino masses has attracted theoretical attention as a possible clue to dark energy physics. The observed dark energy density corresponds to an energy scale of roughly a few milli-electron volts, remarkably close to the neutrino mass scale inferred from oscillation experiments. Whether this coincidence reflects some deep connection between neutrino physics and dark energy or is merely numerical accident remains unclear. Theoretical proposals linking these scales exist but have not achieved consensus acceptance.@@Phantom dark energy, with equation of state w less than -1, would cause the energy density to increase as the universe expands, leading to eventual divergence in a Big Rip scenario. Observational constraints currently permit mild phantom behavior, though values significantly below -1 are excluded. Theoretically, phantom fields face serious challenges including instabilities and violation of energy conditions. Most cosmologists consider w less than -1 unlikely, but ongoing observations continue to test this possibility.@@Coupled dark energy models allow interactions between dark matter and dark energy beyond gravitational effects, potentially affecting the expansion history and structure growth differently than uncoupled models. Such couplings could help address the coincidence problem by linking the evolution of the two dark sectors. Observational constraints on coupling strength come from the cosmic microwave background, structure formation, and other probes. While current data show no evidence for significant coupling, the possibility remains open and motivates continued testing.@@The integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect describes how cosmic microwave background photons gain or lose energy traversing time-evolving gravitational potentials, producing correlations between the CMB temperature and the distribution of matter along the line of sight. In a matter-dominated universe, gravitational potentials remain constant and the effect vanishes, but dark energy causes potentials to decay, producing a detectable signal. Cross-correlation between CMB temperature maps and galaxy surveys has detected the integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect, providing independent evidence for dark energy. The measurement also constrains the timing of dark energy domination.@@Alcock-Paczynski tests use the geometric properties of observed structures to constrain cosmological parameters, particularly through the ratio of radial to transverse distances. Any spherically symmetric structure will appear distorted if analyzed with incorrect cosmological parameters, with the distortion depending on the Hubble parameter and angular diameter distance. Baryon acoustic oscillations provide a convenient standard ruler for this test, as the acoustic scale is known from physics and appears in both radial and transverse directions. Alcock-Paczynski measurements from galaxy surveys contribute to dark energy constraints.@@Redshift-space distortions arise from the peculiar velocities of galaxies superimposed on the Hubble flow, causing apparent displacements along the line of sight in redshift surveys. On large scales, coherent infall toward overdensities compresses structures in redshift space, while on small scales, random motions within virialized systems cause elongation along the line of sight. The amplitude of large-scale distortions measures the growth rate of structure, providing tests of general relativity and constraints on modified gravity. Combining redshift-space distortions with other probes breaks degeneracies and improves cosmological parameter estimation.@@The growth rate of structure, conventionally parameterized as f times sigma-8 where f is the logarithmic derivative of the growth factor and sigma-8 is the amplitude of fluctuations on 8 Mpc/h scales, serves as a key observable for testing gravity. In general relativity, the growth rate is determined by the matter density parameter, while modified gravity theories can produce different growth rates for the same expansion history. Current measurements from redshift-space distortions and other probes are broadly consistent with general relativity, though some analyses suggest slight tension. Future surveys will achieve the precision needed to detect percent-level deviations.@@Gravitational slip, the difference between the two metric potentials in the Newtonian gauge, vanishes in general relativity for a pressureless fluid but can be nonzero in modified gravity theories. Measuring gravitational slip requires comparing probes sensitive to different potentials: weak lensing responds to their sum while galaxy velocities respond to one potential alone. Current constraints on gravitational slip are consistent with zero but have large uncertainties. Detection of nonzero slip would provide smoking-gun evidence for modified gravity, motivating continued observational efforts.@@The Parameterized Post-Friedmann framework provides a systematic way to describe deviations from general relativity in cosmology, analogous to the parameterized post-Newtonian framework for solar system tests. This approach introduces functions of time and scale that modify the growth of structure and gravitational lensing, allowing model-independent tests of gravity. Different modified gravity theories predict specific forms for these functions, enabling observational discrimination. This framework has become standard for reporting constraints on gravity from cosmological surveys.@@Screening mechanisms allow modified gravity theories to reproduce general relativity in the solar system and laboratory while producing significant effects on cosmological scales. Various mechanisms have been proposed, including chameleon screening where the scalar field mass increases in dense environments, symmetron screening where the scalar field value changes sign, and Vainshtein screening where nonlinear derivative interactions suppress modifications. Each mechanism has distinct observational signatures, from violations of the equivalence principle to scale-dependent growth. Testing screening mechanisms requires observations spanning from laboratory to cosmological scales.@@Laboratory searches for fifth forces and violations of the equivalence principle constrain the parameter space of modified gravity theories, complementing cosmological tests. Torsion balance experiments, atom interferometry, and neutron physics provide sensitive probes of possible new forces at short distances. For theories with screening mechanisms, laboratory tests probe the transition between screened and unscreened regimes. The interplay between laboratory, astrophysical, and cosmological constraints provides comprehensive tests of gravity across all accessible scales.@@Dwarf galaxies and galaxy clusters serve as astrophysical laboratories for testing dark matter and modified gravity, as their dynamics are dominated by the dark sector. Dwarf galaxies, with their low surface brightness and large dark matter fractions, are particularly sensitive to the small-scale predictions of different dark matter models. Galaxy clusters, as the largest virialized structures, test gravity on megaparsec scales and constrain dark matter self-interactions through their density profiles and merger dynamics. Tensions between predictions and observations in these systems motivate continued scrutiny of dark sector physics.@@The bullet cluster and similar merging systems provide dramatic evidence for dark matter through the offset between the gravitational lensing signal, tracing total mass, and the X-ray emission from hot gas. In these systems, the gas has been slowed by ram pressure during the collision while the dark matter has passed through relatively unimpeded, demonstrating that most of the mass does not interact strongly. This separation is difficult to explain in modified gravity theories without dark matter, as the lensing signal should follow the baryonic mass. Observations of multiple merging clusters consistently show similar offsets, strengthening the case for particle dark matter.@@Direct detection experiments seek to observe dark matter particles scattering off target nuclei in ultra-sensitive underground detectors. Despite decades of effort with ever-increasing sensitivity, no convincing detection has been reported, excluding large portions of the parameter space for WIMP dark matter. Current experiments using xenon, argon, and other targets continue to improve sensitivity, approaching the neutrino floor where solar and atmospheric neutrinos become an irreducible background. The null results increasingly constrain the WIMP paradigm, motivating consideration of alternative dark matter candidates and detection strategies.@@Indirect detection searches for signatures of dark matter annihilation or decay through their products including gamma rays, neutrinos, positrons, and antiprotons. The Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope has extensively searched for gamma-ray signals from the galactic center, dwarf galaxies, and galaxy clusters. While tantalizing excesses have been reported, including the galactic center excess, none has been definitively attributed to dark matter. Interpretation is complicated by astrophysical backgrounds and uncertainties in the dark matter density distribution. Continued observations and improved modeling may eventually yield a clear detection or definitively exclude thermal relic dark matter.@@Collider searches for dark matter at the Large Hadron Collider look for events with large missing transverse energy where dark matter particles carry away momentum without leaving detector signals. While no dark matter has been discovered, these searches exclude portions of parameter space complementary to direct detection, particularly for light dark matter candidates. The combination of direct detection, indirect detection, and collider constraints provides a comprehensive assault on the WIMP hypothesis. The continued absence of signals is pushing attention toward alternative dark matter scenarios.@@Axion detection experiments exploit the coupling of axions to electromagnetism, which allows axion-photon conversion in strong magnetic fields. The ADMX experiment and similar haloscopes search for axion dark matter through resonant conversion in microwave cavities, achieving sensitivity to QCD axions in certain mass ranges. Light-shining-through-wall experiments and helioscopes search for axion production and conversion through independent means. The axion remains a well-motivated dark matter candidate with a rich experimental program spanning multiple detection techniques.@@Sterile neutrino dark matter could produce observable X-ray lines through radiative decay, and several experiments have reported possible detections of a 3.5 keV line that could have this origin. However, the interpretation remains controversial, with some analyses finding the line and others not, and proposed astrophysical explanations for any signal. Future X-ray observatories with improved energy resolution may definitively resolve whether the 3.5 keV feature represents sterile neutrino decay, atomic emission, or systematic artifact.@@The cosmic neutrino background, relic neutrinos from the early universe analogous to the cosmic microwave background, has never been directly detected due to the extreme weakness of neutrino interactions at the meV energies involved. The PTOLEMY experiment proposes to detect these relic neutrinos through capture on tritium, exploiting the fact that capture produces slightly more energetic electrons than beta decay. Detection of the cosmic neutrino background would provide a snapshot of the universe from merely one second after the Big Bang, far earlier than the CMB. The technical challenges are formidable, requiring unprecedented energy resolution and background rejection.@@The matter power spectrum measured from galaxy surveys shows remarkable agreement with theoretical predictions, validating the gravitational instability paradigm for structure formation. On large scales, the power spectrum retains the primordial shape established during inflation, modified by the transfer function describing how different scales enter the horizon at different times. On smaller scales, nonlinear evolution and baryonic effects complicate the picture, requiring simulations for accurate predictions. The acoustic feature from baryon acoustic oscillations appears as a subtle wiggle in the power spectrum, providing a standard ruler calibrated by early universe physics.@@Galaxy bias, the relationship between the distribution of galaxies and the underlying matter distribution, represents a key uncertainty in interpreting galaxy surveys cosmologically. Galaxies form preferentially in massive dark matter halos, so their clustering is enhanced relative to dark matter, with the bias factor depending on galaxy type, luminosity, and redshift. On large scales, bias is approximately linear and scale-independent, but on smaller scales and for highly biased tracers, the relationship becomes more complex. Accurate modeling of galaxy bias is essential for extracting cosmological information from galaxy surveys.@@Halo occupation distribution models describe how galaxies populate dark matter halos statistically, providing a framework for interpreting galaxy clustering and galaxy-galaxy lensing measurements. These empirical models specify the probability that a halo of given mass contains a certain number of galaxies, along with their spatial distribution within the halo. Fitting HOD models to observations constrains both cosmological parameters and the galaxy-halo connection. More sophisticated approaches using subhalo abundance matching and semi-analytic models provide additional physical insight into galaxy formation.@@The splashback radius defines the physical boundary of dark matter halos where material on first infall reaches its farthest extent before falling back, creating a sharp feature in the density profile. This feature, predicted by simulations and recently detected observationally through galaxy and weak lensing profiles, provides a physically motivated halo boundary distinct from arbitrary overdensity definitions. The splashback radius depends on accretion rate and cosmology, potentially providing new cosmological tests. Its detection demonstrates how high-quality data can reveal subtle features matching theoretical predictions.@@Assembly bias refers to the dependence of halo clustering on properties beyond mass, such as concentration, formation time, and spin. At fixed mass, early-forming halos cluster more strongly than late-forming ones, potentially affecting cosmological inferences if not properly accounted for. Whether assembly bias propagates to observable galaxy properties remains debated, with different analyses reaching different conclusions. Understanding and modeling assembly bias is important for precision cosmology with galaxy surveys.@@Intrinsic alignments of galaxies, physical correlations in galaxy shapes due to formation in shared tidal fields rather than gravitational lensing, represent a significant systematic for weak lensing cosmology. If not properly modeled, intrinsic alignments can bias cosmological parameter estimates from cosmic shear measurements. Various models describe intrinsic alignment amplitude and scale dependence, with parameters constrained from observations. Current surveys marginalize over intrinsic alignment parameters, degrading constraints but providing robust results. Improved understanding of intrinsic alignments from simulations and observations will benefit future surveys.@@Photometric redshifts, estimated from broad-band colors rather than spectroscopic features, enable cosmological analysis of galaxies too faint for spectroscopy. The accuracy of photometric redshifts depends on filter coverage, photometric precision, and the training sample used for calibration. Catastrophic outliers, where photometric redshifts differ greatly from true values, pose particular challenges for weak lensing tomography. Extensive effort goes into characterizing and calibrating photometric redshift distributions, often using cross-correlation techniques with spectroscopic samples.@@Blending and deblending in crowded fields affect galaxy shape measurements for weak lensing, as overlapping images complicate centroid determination and shape estimation. Future deep surveys will face increasingly severe blending, requiring sophisticated algorithms to identify and characterize blended systems. Unrecognized blends can bias shear estimates and photometric redshifts, propagating to cosmological parameter errors. Machine learning approaches show promise for improving deblending performance, though systematic characterization remains challenging.@@Point spread function modeling represents another key systematic for weak lensing, as imperfect knowledge of the telescope optics and atmosphere affects inferred galaxy shapes. The PSF varies across the focal plane and with time, requiring interpolation from measured stellar images. Residual PSF modeling errors can produce coherent spurious shear patterns mimicking cosmological signals. Space-based observations offer more stable PSF but still require careful characterization, while ground-based surveys must account for atmospheric turbulence.@@Shear calibration corrects for multiplicative and additive biases in galaxy shape measurements arising from noise, pixelization, and PSF effects. These biases can be characterized through image simulations with known input shears, requiring realistic galaxy populations and observing conditions. The GREAT challenges and ongoing calibration efforts have improved shear measurement accuracy, but residual calibration uncertainties remain significant for current surveys. Achieving the sub-percent calibration accuracy required for future surveys remains an active area of development.@@Higher-order statistics beyond the two-point function contain cosmological information not captured by power spectra or correlation functions. The bispectrum, three-point function, and higher-order correlations are sensitive to primordial non-Gaussianity, nonlinear growth, and the galaxy-halo connection. Peak counts, void statistics, and other non-Gaussian measures from weak lensing maps access information from the full matter distribution. Machine learning approaches can extract this higher-order information efficiently, potentially tightening cosmological constraints significantly beyond two-point analyses.@@Field-level inference attempts to extract cosmological information from the full three-dimensional matter distribution rather than compressed statistics, potentially capturing more information and enabling joint inference of cosmology and initial conditions. This approach requires accurate forward modeling of structure formation and galaxy observation, computationally intensive sampling or optimization, and careful treatment of systematic effects. While still developing, field-level methods represent a promising direction for maximizing the scientific return from cosmological surveys.@@The cosmic infrared background, the integrated infrared emission from all galaxies throughout cosmic history, encodes information about star formation and dust reprocessing across cosmic time. Fluctuations in this background trace the large-scale structure of the universe and correlate with other tracers of mass. The cosmic infrared background has been measured by Spitzer, Herschel, and Planck, revealing the history of obscured star formation. Cross-correlation with galaxy surveys and gravitational lensing provides additional cosmological information.@@The cosmic X-ray background arises from the integrated emission of active galactic nuclei and hot gas in galaxies and clusters. Resolved point sources account for most of the background in different energy bands, with the remaining unresolved component constraining the population of faint or obscured sources. The spatial fluctuations of the unresolved background trace large-scale structure and constrain the clustering of X-ray sources. Future X-ray surveys will resolve fainter sources and better characterize the background.@@The epoch of cosmic dawn, when the first stars and galaxies formed and began illuminating the universe, represents a frontier for observational cosmology. The James Webb Space Telescope is revealing galaxies at redshifts beyond 10, providing the first detailed view of this epoch. Radio observations targeting the 21-centimeter signal probe the distribution of neutral hydrogen before and during reionization. Understanding cosmic dawn requires combining multiple observational techniques with theoretical models of early structure formation.@@Cosmological hydrodynamical simulations now achieve remarkable fidelity in reproducing observed galaxy populations, providing theoretical predictions for comparison with data and training sets for machine learning analyses. Simulations like IllustrisTNG, EAGLE, and SIMBA include prescriptions for star formation, supernova and AGN feedback, and chemical enrichment, producing galaxies with realistic masses, sizes, colors, and morphologies. Comparison between different simulations reveals the sensitivity of predictions to uncertain subgrid physics. These simulations serve as essential tools for interpreting observations and testing galaxy formation models.@@Emulators interpolate between simulation outputs to provide rapid predictions for arbitrary parameter values, enabling efficient parameter inference and survey optimization. Cosmic emulators for the matter power spectrum, halo mass function, and other quantities have been constructed from suites of N-body and hydrodynamical simulations. Gaussian processes and neural networks provide the interpolation, with accuracy validated against held-out simulations. Emulators make it practical to explore high-dimensional parameter spaces that would be intractable with direct simulation.@@Forward modeling approaches generate synthetic observations from assumed cosmological and astrophysical parameters, comparing directly with data rather than relying on summary statistics. This methodology naturally accounts for selection effects, measurement errors, and complex systematic effects. Examples include forward modeling of supernova cosmology, cluster cosmology, and strong lensing time delays. While computationally intensive, forward modeling provides a principled framework for cosmological inference.@@Bayesian model comparison provides a framework for assessing the relative support for different cosmological models given the data, accounting for model complexity through the evidence or marginal likelihood. The Bayes factor between models quantifies the odds ratio updating from prior to posterior, penalizing models with unnecessary parameters. Application to cosmological model selection, such as comparing Lambda-CDM to extensions, requires careful treatment of prior choices and numerical integration challenges. While useful, Bayesian model comparison has limitations and should be combined with other approaches.@@Tensions and anomalies in cosmological data warrant careful investigation to determine whether they indicate new physics, systematic errors, or statistical fluctuations. The Hubble tension remains the most significant current discrepancy, with no clear resolution. Other potential tensions include the sigma-8 discrepancy between CMB and low-redshift probes, the lensing amplitude in Planck data, and various large-scale CMB anomalies. Each requires investigation of possible systematic effects before concluding that new physics is required.@@The hemispherical power asymmetry in the CMB, with one hemisphere showing slightly stronger fluctuations than the other, represents one of several large-scale anomalies that have attracted theoretical attention. While individually of modest statistical significance, the collection of anomalies has prompted speculation about departures from statistical isotropy, non-standard inflation, or effects from beyond the observable universe. Most cosmologists regard these features as likely statistical flukes, but they continue to motivate investigation.@@The cold spot in the CMB, an unusually large and cold region in the southern sky, has been proposed as evidence for various exotic phenomena including a supervoid, cosmic texture, or imprint from a colliding bubble universe. Follow-up observations have characterized foreground structures that may contribute to the feature. While no consensus explanation exists, the cold spot illustrates how individual CMB features can motivate both mundane and exotic interpretations.@@Cosmological tests of fundamental physics extend beyond gravity to probe Lorentz invariance, variation of fundamental constants, and the equivalence principle. Observations of distant quasars, gamma-ray bursts, and gravitational waves constrain violations of Lorentz invariance at high energies. Spectroscopic observations of quasar absorption systems constrain time variation of the fine structure constant and proton-to-electron mass ratio. These tests probe physics at energies and distances inaccessible to laboratory experiments.@@The cosmological constant, if truly constant, implies a de Sitter-like future for the universe, with profound implications for the long-term fate of observers and information. In eternal de Sitter space, any local region eventually becomes isolated within a cosmic event horizon, experiencing thermal fluctuations from the de Sitter temperature. The Boltzmann brain problem asks whether typical observers are ordinary beings evolved through natural processes or statistical fluctuations in de Sitter equilibrium. This seemingly absurd question has prompted serious consideration of measure problems and the nature of observation in cosmology.@@Cosmology and astrobiology intersect in considering the cosmic conditions necessary for life and the prevalence of habitable environments throughout the universe. The fine-tuning of cosmological parameters for structure formation and chemistry is sometimes invoked as evidence for design or for anthropic selection in a multiverse. The distribution of potentially habitable planets in galaxies and the cosmic evolution of habitability depend on cosmological parameters. While highly speculative, these considerations connect cosmology to fundamental questions about life's place in the universe.@@The overview effect, experienced by astronauts viewing Earth from space, extends metaphorically to the cosmological perspective that reveals our planet as a pale blue dot in an immense cosmos. This perspective, emphasized by Carl Sagan and others, carries philosophical and ethical implications about human unity and environmental stewardship. Cosmology thus contributes not only to scientific understanding but to the broader human project of understanding our place in existence.
